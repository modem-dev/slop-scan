# Benchmarks

This directory contains **recreatable pinned benchmark sets** for `repo-slop-analyzer`.

## Why this exists

The analyzer is heuristic, so we need benchmark cohorts that can be rerun later against the exact same upstream revisions.

A pinned benchmark set gives us:
- exact repo membership
- exact commit SHAs
- saved snapshot results
- a generated markdown report
- a reproducible blended score that summarizes the six normalized metrics

## Included set

- `benchmarks/sets/known-ai-vs-solid-oss.json`

This set compares:
- a cohort of known AI-generated JS/TS repos
- against older, well-regarded JS/TS OSS repos

AI provenance may come from public README disclosures or user-provided provenance used during benchmark calibration.

The generated report also includes a **blended score**: the geometric mean of each repo's six normalized-metric ratios versus the mature OSS medians, rescaled so the mature OSS median is 1.00.

## Reproduce the saved snapshot

Fetch the pinned checkouts:

```bash
bun run benchmark:fetch
```

Scan them with the analyzer's **default config**:

```bash
bun run benchmark:scan
```

Regenerate the markdown report:

```bash
bun run benchmark:report
```

Or do all three:

```bash
bun run benchmark:update
```

## Artifacts

For the current set:
- manifest: `benchmarks/sets/known-ai-vs-solid-oss.json`
- saved snapshot: `benchmarks/results/known-ai-vs-solid-oss.json`
- generated report: `reports/known-ai-vs-solid-oss-benchmark.md`

## Notes

- Checkouts are stored under `benchmarks/.cache/` and are gitignored.
- The benchmark currently scans only JS/TS-family files.
- Mixed-language repos are therefore only partially represented.
- Saved snapshots should be regenerated intentionally when the benchmark set or analyzer changes.
