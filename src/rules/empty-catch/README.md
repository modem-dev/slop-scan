# defensive.empty-catch

Flags empty catch blocks that silently suppress failures.

- **Family:** `defensive`
- **Severity:** `strong`
- **Scope:** `file`
- **Requires:** `file.tryCatchSummaries`

## How it works

The rule reports small try/catch blocks when the catch body is empty.
It intentionally skips:

- common filesystem-existence probes
- documented local fallbacks where the try block only resolves local values and the catch explains that execution should fall through to another source
- larger try blocks where this structural approximation is less trustworthy

## Flagged example

```ts
export function parseConfig(raw: string) {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(raw);
  } catch {}

  return null;
}
```

## Usually ignored

```ts
export function loadTheme() {
  let stored: string | null = null;

  try {
    stored = localStorage.getItem("theme");
  } catch {
    // fall through to the default theme
  }

  return stored ?? "light";
}
```

## Scoring

Each flagged catch uses the shared try/catch scoring helper, then the file total is capped at `8`.
Boundary-oriented catches are downweighted instead of fully ignored.
